# Corvallis Parks Storymap

This story map was created for a lab exercise for course GEOG 572 Geovisual Analytics. For this exercise, I created a storymap that's theme is related to the city parks of Corvallis. 

The base layer is that was used is the Mapbox Street Satellite theme. This was due to the fact that the satellite gives the user a good sense of the setting of the park and streets being labeled gives a sense of location due to the zoom level of the scenes. Zoom level was not added to the basemap due to the desire to keep the user at the predetermined zoom level. Each scene, when applicable, has a legend and a scale bar. A clipart image of a tree was used for a favicon to fit with the common theme of parks.

The intro scene contains a geojson file that contains a polygon for each park in the city. If the mouse hovers over the polygon, the name of that respective park will pop-up.  The remaining layers have additional geojson files that are loaded onto the base layer to show the extent of the park.
